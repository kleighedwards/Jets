## "Jets" - An Intro to Object Oriented Programming

Upon launching this program, the user is shown a menu with a variety of options to choose from. 

If the user selects 1, they are shown a list of jets in the current fleet.

If the user selects 2, they will be shown the fastest jet in the fleet.

If the user selects option 3, they will be shown the jet with the longest range.

If the user selects option 4, they will be allowed to add their own jet to the fleet. The program will ask 
them a series of questions about the jet they would like to add (such as the model or the speed of the aircraft).
Once the program has collected all the necessary information, it will now display the updated list of jets.
The user can select option 4 as many times as they would like.

At this point, if the user were to select option 2 or 3, the program would display the new fastest jet or the new
jet with the furthest range (provided this new aircraft exceeds the previous records).

If the user selects option 5 (at any point) the program will terminate.
